## Shuttle Bus

There will again be a shuttle bus for WOA 2025 from Monday to Saturday, between 10 AM and 6:30 PM.
Departure starts at the [Festival Bus Stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UWz5M6ubptoVko286) at the corner of Bokelrehmer Straße / Vierthweg (Bokelrehmer Weg).

This year we have an additional bus stop at the [LGH Clubstage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ttYHz65VsXD3niVP6) (Landgasthof).

The bus costs €2 per ride, and entry to the swimming pool is €3.

## Payment

**Payment in the swimming pool and bus is cash only.**
